Title: SHTF Emergency WiFi Chat System

Description:
The SHTF Emergency WiFi Chat System is a crucial open-source project designed to address the need for resilient communication in emergency situations when traditional means of communication, such as cell phone towers and the internet, may be unavailable. When the proverbial "shit hits the fan" and communities need a reliable way to stay connected, this solution becomes a lifeline for individuals and groups.

Key Features:
- **WiFi-Based Communication**: This system leverages WiFi technology to create a local, decentralized communication network. By connecting to a common WiFi access point (AP) named "EmergencyWifiWebChat," users can send and receive messages without relying on external infrastructure.

- **M5StickCPlus Integration**: The project is built on the M5StickCPlus platform, a compact and versatile development board that combines a microcontroller with an LCD display. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the emergency chat system.

- **Resilient Message Storage**: The system allows users to send and receive text messages through a simple web interface. Messages are stored locally on the device, ensuring that critical information is not lost, even when network connections are sporadic or unreliable.

- **Community-Centric Approach**: This communication solution is designed with local communities in mind. In times of crisis, community members can connect to the local WiFi network, share important updates, coordinate actions, and provide support to one another.

- **Signal Extender Compatibility**: The system is extendable using WiFi signal extenders, which can help increase the network's coverage range. This feature is invaluable in scenarios where the affected area is large, and users need to communicate over longer distances.

- **Message History**: The chat interface displays a history of the most recent messages, allowing users to stay informed and engaged. This feature ensures that information flows smoothly within the community.

The SHTF Emergency WiFi Chat System serves as a vital tool for enhancing emergency preparedness and response efforts. It empowers communities to maintain essential communication channels even in the absence of conventional infrastructure, making it a valuable asset during times of crisis.

Please note that the project is open-source, meaning that the code and design can be freely shared and adapted to meet the specific needs of different communities and scenarios. Whether you're preparing for the worst or seeking a resilient communication solution for local communities, this project provides a solid foundation to build upon. Join us in making the world a safer place, one line of code at a time.
